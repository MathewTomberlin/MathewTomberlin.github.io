        <h2>Game Programmer</h2>
        <p>
            Mathew Tomberlin has been an independent video game developer since 2013. His studio, Red Tentacle Games, has developed mobile, desktop and VR games in genres ranging from Battle Royale to mobile minigames.
            Mathew attended California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB), where he graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and a concentration in Game Programming. While at CSUMB, Mat developed his technical and teamwork skills by working with a team of artists,
            programmers and sound designers on a VR horror game called <i>Just One Night</i>, which utilized a unique, immersive player locomotion technique developed by Mathew known as Gauntlet traversal. He would later
            publish a paper about the <i>Gauntlet traversal technique</i> through the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) VR 2017 conference.
            <br /><br />
            Mat solely developed a networked, multiplayer DirectX 11 first-person shooter game with an interesting skiing movement system inspired by the <i>Tribes</i> game series.
            For a personal project, he developed a top-down, procedurally generated stealth-shooter in Unreal Engine 4, akin to <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>, known as <i>Replication Extermination</i>. Later that year, he worked with professor Krzysztof Pietroszek and
            Mila Liudmila to develop an education and research game which used a Neurosky Mindwave EEG headset to adapt the game's difficulty setting to a player's registered attention level, making the game harder if the player
            was winning without paying attention or easier if they lost while paying a lot of attention. This game was to be used to study the affects of adaptive difficulty settings on patients with ADHD.
            <br /><br />
            During Mat's senior year, he taught a game development class to highschool students at Everette Alvarez Highschool utilizing PlayCanvas (a Chromebook
            friendly, browser-based Javascript game engine similar to Unity3D). For that course, he wrote 36 pages of Javascript, PlayCanvas and generic game design documentation for the students.
            Simultaneously, Mat worked closely with a game designer and two programmers to design game mechanics and develop an educational, underwater VR game called <i>Open Ocean VR</i> in Unity3D. Mat was responsible for 3D modeling each of the
            marine wildlife in Blender, programming their movement behaviors and the game's event system as well as creating Unity 3D tools for level designers to utilize.
            <br /><br />
            Throughout his time at CSUMB, Mat continued developing two personal projects, which are both currently under development. <i>FLEET: Solar Empire</i> is a strategic spaceship and fleet command game. In <i>FLEET</i>, the player streams their
            gameplay on Twitch, which allows their viewers to issue chatroom-based commands to each of their own characters aboard the player's spaceships. Players use their viewers to capture enemy ships and spacestations, to pilot fighters and to mine resources.
            Mat's second personal project currently in development is <i>Combat Descent</i>, a third-person shooter in the Battle Royale genre. Each player in Combat Descent is equipped with a jetpack which they must make use of to navigate a deep, procedurally
            generated voxel cavern system. Players must fight against rivals while trying to reach a portal deep within the caverns.

        <h2>US Marine Corps Veteran</h2>
        <p>
            Before Mathew became a video game developer, he was a sergeant in the US Marine Corps. Mat attended the Defense Language Institute, Foreign Language Center in Monterey, CA in 2007 and graduated in 2009, when he was certified as a Cryptologic Linguist specializing in Korean.
            Mat deployed in support of Special Operations Forces during Operation Enduring Freedom, setup and maintained mission critical satellite communications equipment in jungle environments, facilitated medical and electronic equipment training courses for foreign military personnel
            and collected intelligence in support of US military missions. Mat has traveled around the world and operated sensitive equipment in rugged and dangerous locations.
