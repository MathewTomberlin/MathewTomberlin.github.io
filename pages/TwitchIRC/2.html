        The most successful Twitch IRC games are turn-based or slow enough to account for the ~5 seconds of delay, require little data to be shown on screen for each viewer character and have a means
        to account for viewers coming and going from the channel. Turn-based roleplaying games, like classic <i>Final Fantasy</i> games work particularly well because the game waits for a user's input before
        any more actions occur. A Twitch IRC RPG like this would limit the number of active players to 4 (like a classic RPG), associating a particular viewer with a specific character. The game would wait
        for each of the 4 viewer's input, one at a time, ignoring any other chat input until that viewer issued their command. The game would have an on-screen timer, maybe 2 minutes, to determine if the player was still
        active and then kick them from the party if it determined they were idle. By their nature, these RPGs showed each character's stats on screen at the same time and their particular combat options when it
        was their turn.

        Taking the above hypothetical Twitch IRC RPG as a base model, we can do a lot more with our screen space and input format. While turn-based games work the best with Stream Delay, we can make a realtime
        roleplaying game by constraining the types of actions a viewer can take. When a viewer takes an action, that action should not be seen as an immediate effect, in most cases, but rather as a change to a different
        persistent state, such as Dodging, Moving, Attacking. These states should have effects over time instead of all at once, reducing the negative impact of Stream Delay. In these games, all weapons do damage over
        time instead of instantaneous damage and strategically selecting the right option becomes more important than speed or dexterity.
