        Hello and welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Mat and this is mainly a collection of projects I have developed 
        since my honorable seperation from the Marine Corps in 2012. Some of the projects you'll see here were developed
        solely by myself and a few others were created while attending California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB).
        Game development is both a logical amalgamation of my best skills and the best form of my one true passion:
         storytelling.

        I have been writing fiction and illustrating for as long as I can remember, I have studied 3d art 
        for over 15 years and programming for nearly 10 years. I graduated from California State University, Monterey Bay 
        with a B.S. in Computer Science, concentrating on Game Programming, but I studied illustration and 3d modeling for 
        three semesters at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco 6 years earlier. Before all of my formal training,
        I used (ancient) game engines like ZZT and MZX, Dark Basic and the RPG Maker series. Nowadays I mainly use Unity and
        Unreal Engine 4 alongside software like Blender and GIMP.

        I am very passionate about game development. Nearly all of my time is spent developing my own personal video game projects,
        which tend to be complex and include at least one novel gameplay feature, such as Twitch IRC or networked multiplayer. I like
        to work on the kinds of games that I enjoy playing, particularly fast paced games with deep stories and intruiging game mechanics.
        Over the years my skills have grown considerably, with my earliest games being clones of classic games like Breakout, Simon and Lights
        Out. My more recent game projects tend to be quite behemoth in scope, such as Combat Descent, a networked multiplayer Battle Royale
        developed in Unreal Engine 4 or FLEET: Solar Empire, a RTS space command game utilizing Twitch IRC to allow a Twitch streamer's viewers
        to play alongside him as crew members.

        Despite my many personal projects, I am actively looking for employment with a game development studio. I am very much looking forward
        to finding like-minded game engineers and artists who are passionate about creating the kinds of games they like to play. If you're a
        studio looking a self-driven game programmer, I might be just who you're looking for!
