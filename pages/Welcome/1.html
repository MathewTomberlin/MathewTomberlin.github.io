        Hello and welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Mat and this is mainly a collection of projects I have developed 
        since my honorable seperation from the Marine Corps in 2012. Some of the projects you'll see here were developed
        solely by myself and a few others were created while attending California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB).
        Game development is both a logical amalgamation of my best skills and the best form of my one true passion:
         storytelling.

        I have been writing fiction and illustrating for as long as I can remember, I have studied 3d art 
        for over 15 years and programming for nearly 10 years. I graduated from California State University, Monterey Bay 
        with a B.S. in Computer Science, concentrating on Game Programming, but I studied illustration and 3d modeling for 
        three semesters at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco 6 years earlier. Before all of my formal training,
        I used (ancient) game engines like ZZT and MZX, Dark Basic and the RPG Maker series. Nowadays I mainly use Unity and
        Unreal Engine 4 alongside software like Blender and GIMP.
